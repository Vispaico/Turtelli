<p>Turtle Trading is what happens when someone looks at the market and says: “Cool story. Where’s the rulebook?” It’s systematic trend following with breakout entries, volatility-based risk, and a stubborn refusal to negotiate with your feelings.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever bought a breakout, felt like a genius for 11 minutes, then watched price reverse like it got your home address… welcome. Turtle Trading doesn’t promise you’ll feel smart. It tries to keep you alive long enough to catch the moves that actually matter.</p>

<p>New to the whole thing? Read this first, then jump to <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a> (entries/exits), and then <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a> (risk). That trio is basically the “turtles in three bites” combo meal.</p>
</div>

<h2>The origin story (Dennis, Eckhardt, and a wildly expensive argument)</h2>

<p>Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt had a debate that every trader has at some point: are great traders born, or can you train them? Dennis thought you could teach rules. Eckhardt thought “yeah sure, and I can teach my cat to do taxes.” They recruited students, taught them a system, and the turtles became one of the most famous trading experiments ever.</p>

<p>You can read the background on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Dennis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eckhardt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Eckhardt</a> if you want the history. The practical takeaway is simpler: rules + risk control can beat vibes.</p>

<h2>What Turtle Trading is (in normal-person language)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entry:</strong> buy when price breaks above the highest high of the last N days (breakout).</li>

  <li><strong>Exit:</strong> get out when price breaks below a shorter lookback low (or your stop gets hit).</li>

  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> size by volatility (ATR) so every trade risks roughly the same amount.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. It’s not “secret.” It’s just annoyingly disciplined. The hardest part is doing it after three losses in a row when your brain starts writing conspiracy theories about Donchian channels.</p>

<h2>Why breakouts at all?</h2>

<p>Breakouts are basically a lazy way to let the market prove strength. Instead of guessing “is this a new uptrend?” you wait until price actually pushes into new territory. You’ll miss some bottoms. You’ll also avoid some “catching knives” that look cheap right before they keep falling.</p>

<p>For the behavioral explanation (the human stuff), read <a href="/articles/why-trend-following-works-market-psychology">Why trend following works</a>. It’s the “why this keeps being a thing” article.</p>

<h2>The part everyone skips: what it feels like</h2>

<p>Trend following has three emotional seasons: (1) boredom, (2) mild pain, (3) “wait, why is this suddenly working?” Boredom is the default because good systems don’t require constant action. Mild pain shows up because breakouts can fail repeatedly. Then, once in a while, a trend runs and pays for the whole mess.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you hate boredom, you’ll sabotage yourself by inventing trades.</li>

  <li>If you hate small losses, you’ll move stops and turn “small” into “oops.”</li>

  <li>If you can accept both, you give yourself a chance to catch the rare, big move.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple “do this weekly” setup (beginner edition)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Pick a universe you can stick with (20–100 liquid markets). Don’t change it daily because you found a new shiny ticker.</li>

  <li>Pick one timeframe (daily) and one breakout window (20 or 55).</li>

  <li>Decide risk per trade and write it down. Then read <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR</a> and actually use it.</li>

  <li>Run the scan on a schedule. If you check every hour, you’re not trading — you’re doomscrolling with candles.</li>

  <li>Journal: entry reason, risk, exit rule. If you can’t explain it, it wasn’t a rule-based trade.</li>
</ol>

<p>Put a “Turtle loop” graphic here: Scan → Size → Enter → Place stop → Do nothing → Exit by rule → Repeat. If you make it funny, people will screenshot it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Common beginner mistakes (the expensive hits)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trading too many markets at once:</strong> you don’t get “diversification,” you get “chaos.” Start smaller.</li>

  <li><strong>Ignoring costs:</strong> breakouts happen when spreads/slippage can be worst. Model it. Respect it.</li>

  <li><strong>Changing the rule after 2 trades:</strong> that’s not improvement, that’s mood swings with a spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>
