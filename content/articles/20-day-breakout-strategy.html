<p>The 20-day breakout (often called <strong>System 1</strong>) is the aggressive engine of the Turtle Trading experiment. It is designed to ensure that you never, ever miss a major trend. If a market moves, System 1 will be in it.</p>

<p>The price you pay for this responsiveness is "Whipsaws." System 1 enters early. It gets fake-out often. It takes many small jabs to the face. But when the market truly rips (think Nvidia in 2023 or Bitcoin in 2017), System 1 is in from the ground floor.</p>

<h2>The Core Rules (No ambiguity allowed)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entry Rule:</strong> Buy when price exceeds the High of the preceding 20 days. Sell Short when price drops below the Low of the preceding 20 days.</li>

  <li><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> 2 × ATR (N) from the entry price.</li>

  <li><strong>Exit Rule:</strong> Exit Long when price touches the 10-day Low. Exit Short when price touches the 10-day High.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deep Dive: The Entry (Don't Wait for Close)</h2>

<p>A common mistake beginners make is waiting for the daily candle to <em>close</em> before entering. <strong>Turtles do not wait.</strong> If the 20-day high is $50.00, and the price ticks to $50.01 at 10:00 AM, you buy. Why? Because in a strong momentum breakout, the price might close at $55.00. If you wait for the close, you missed $5.00 of profit and your risk (stop distance) is now huge. Use <strong>Stop-Limit</strong> or <strong>Stop-Market</strong> orders to enter automatically.</p>

<h2>Deep Dive: The 10-Day Exit (The Give Back)</h2>

<p>Notice the asymmetry. You enter on a 20-day signal, but exit on a 10-day signal. This is crucial. The faster exit allows you to lock in profits before the trend completely reverses.</p>

<p><strong>The Psychology of the Exit:</strong> This is the hardest part.</p>

<p>Let's say you bought at $100. Price goes to $150. You feel like a genius. Then the trend slows. The 10-day low moves up to $140. Price drops to $140. You exit. You feel bad because you "lost" the $10 from the peak ($150 to $140). <strong>Get over it.</strong> You cannot catch the exact top. System 1 ensures you catch the meat, not the bones.</p>

<h2>The "Last Breakout" Filter (Advanced Rule)</h2>

<p>The original Turtles had a special rule for System 1 called the "Filter Rule." <strong>Rule:</strong> Ignore a System 1 breakout signal if the <em>previous</em> System 1 breakout signal for this market was a <strong>winning trade</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> The logic was that markets rarely trend twice in a row without a consolidation. If you just caught a big trend, the next breakout is likely a fake-out. However, if the filtered breakout turns into a massive trend, you re-enter at the System 2 (55-day) level. This is a fail-safe. <em>Note for beginners: You can ignore this rule at first. Taking every signal is simpler.</em></p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Trade Anatomy</h2>

<p>Let's walk through a hypothetical trade in Gold Futures.</p>

<h3>Day 1: The Breakout</h3>

<p>Gold 20-day High is $2000. Price hits $2000.10. You buy 1 Unit. ATR is $20. Stop is at $1960 (2N).</p>

<h3>Day 3: The Add-on (Pyramiding)</h3>

<p>Price moves to $2010 (increase of 0.5N). You buy another Unit. You move stops for BOTH units up to $1970. (Protecting profits).</p>

<h3>Day 20: The Trend</h3>

<p>Price is $2200. You are sitting on huge open profits. You do nothing. You just update your trailing stop (the 10-day low).</p>

<h3>Day 45: The Exit</h3>

<p>Price drops. It touches the 10-day low at $2150. You sell everything. Trade result: Big Win.</p>

<h2>Common Errors with System 1</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Second Guessing:</strong> "This breakout looks weak." You don't know that. Weak-looking breakouts often become strong trends because no one believes them.</li>

  <li><strong>Exiting Early:</strong> "I made 20%, I'll cash out." Then the market goes up another 80% and you cry. System 1 requires you to stay until the 10-day low is hit.</li>

  <li><strong>Re-entering Late:</strong> You got stopped out. The market breaks out again 2 days later. You are "scared" so you don't buy. That second breakout was the real one.</li>
</ul>

<p>System 1 is a grind. It has a lower win rate than System 2 (often 35-40%). But it catches the V-bottoms that System 2 misses. If you want to be the "First in, First out," this is your strategy.</p>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>
