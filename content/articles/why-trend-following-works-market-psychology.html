<p>Trend following annoys people because it’s simple. “Buy when it breaks out, sell when it breaks down” sounds too easy, so everyone assumes it can’t work. Meanwhile, momentum has been documented in finance research for decades. Markets don’t always trend, but when they do, they can trend longer than your brain finds comfortable.</p>

<h2>The human reasons: why price keeps drifting</h2>

<p>A big move often starts small: a change in guidance, policy, energy prices, rates, or just slow rotation. Many participants adjust gradually. Price drifts. Then it becomes obvious. Then everyone piles in. That sequence creates the kind of follow-through trend followers want.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Underreaction:</strong> people adjust slowly to new information.</li>

  <li><strong>Herding:</strong> once a move is obvious, people chase because “everyone else is making money.”</li>

  <li><strong>Career risk:</strong> professionals often prefer being wrong with the crowd than right alone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The plumbing reasons: why breakouts get fuel</h2>

<p>Markets aren’t just opinions. They’re orders. Breakout levels cluster stop orders, entries, and risk management decisions. When a level breaks, a bunch of orders can trigger together. That’s not mystical. It’s just how participants place trades.</p>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Where this connects to Turtle Trading</div>

<p>Turtles use simple levels (<a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>) and simple risk (<a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>). That’s enough structure to benefit when the market does its trending thing.</p>
</div>

<h2>When trend following struggles (and why that’s normal)</h2>

<p>Choppy markets are the tax. Mean-reverting phases can create multiple false breakouts. That’s where many people quit — right before the next trending phase. The answer isn’t a perfect filter. The answer is risk control and enough diversification so chop doesn’t wreck your whole year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep losses small with stops and sizing.</li>

  <li>Diversify across markets (or at least across uncorrelated symbols).</li>

  <li>Stick to a review schedule so you don’t “optimize” mid-drawdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use this without turning it into hype</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Pick a rule set you can follow: <a href="/articles/turtle-system-1-vs-system-2">System 1 vs System 2</a>.</li>

  <li>Use clean levels: <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</li>

  <li>Use risk that keeps you in the game: <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</li>

  <li>Then track your behavior more than your P&L. The behavior is what you control.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple position sizing example (numbers make this click)</h2>

<p>Say your account is $10,000 and you decide to risk 1% per trade. That’s $100. You measure ATR, set a stop distance (often around 2×ATR), and then you size the position so a stop-out loses about $100. That’s how you make each trade equally survivable, even when markets have different volatility.</p>

<p>Example: if your stop distance is $4, you can take roughly 25 shares ($100 / $4). If the stop distance is $10, you take 10 shares. You didn’t “get scared.” The market just got wilder, so you got smaller. That’s the whole philosophy in one sentence.</p>

<h2>Media ideas (easy wins)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A 2–6 minute video: “Breakouts in one chart” + a quick tour of the <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.</li>

  <li>A simple infographic: the “Turtle loop” (Scan → Size → Enter → Stop → Exit → Repeat).</li>

  <li>A shareable checklist graphic (daily + weekly). People love screenshots more than they admit.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Builder note (optional)</div>

<p>Add a small “Share this” CTA after the first big section. People share when you saved them time or made them laugh — ideally both.</p>
</div>

<h2>A tiny story about sticking to rules (because this is where most people lose)</h2>

<p>Picture a normal losing streak: three trades in a row that stop out quickly. Nothing catastrophic, just annoying. Your brain starts negotiating: “Maybe the settings are wrong.” “Maybe I should wait for confirmation.” “Maybe I should just take smaller trades until it ‘feels’ better.”</p>

<p>That negotiation is the danger zone. Not because you’re dumb — because you’re human. Trend following looks worst right before it looks fine again, and the market has a talent for timing your doubts perfectly. The disciplined move is boring: keep the rules, keep the risk consistent, and review on your scheduled day.</p>

<p>If you want a practical way to lock this in, do two things: (1) write your rules in one page, and (2) track a “rule score” each week (0–100%). Improve the score before you change the strategy.</p>
