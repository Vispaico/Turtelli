<p>System 1 vs System 2 is basically “fast turtle vs patient turtle.” Both use the same bones: Donchian breakouts and volatility-based risk. The difference is how often they fire and how much noise you’re willing to sit through.</p>

<p>If you don’t pick a version on purpose, you’ll pick one accidentally based on your mood. And mood-based system selection is how traders become comedians without realizing it.</p>

<div class="tldr-box">
  <div class="tldr-title">TL;DR</div>
  <ul>
    <li>System 1 = 20/10 breakouts: faster entries, more trades, more whipsaws. System 2 = 55/20: slower entries, fewer trades, more waiting.</li>
    <li>Both still need ATR-based sizing and discipline; the rules don’t change, only the pace and the pain.</li>
    <li>Pick the discomfort you can live with: many small losses (S1) vs. long stretches of nothing (S2).</li>
    <li>Write rules, review on a schedule, and track rule-breaking—system choice matters less than sticking to it.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>The quick comparison</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>System 1:</strong> more signals, more stop-outs, more action.</li>

  <li><strong>System 2:</strong> fewer signals, fewer stop-outs, more waiting.</li>

  <li><strong>Both:</strong> still need sizing and discipline to survive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What actually changes in the rules</h2>

<p>The indicator is still <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>. The common setup is: System 1 enters on a 20-day breakout and exits on a 10-day reversal. System 2 enters on a 55-day breakout and exits on a 20-day reversal.</p>

<p>Risk stays the same idea: size by volatility and protect the downside. If you skipped that, you’re missing the most important part. Read <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a> and come back.</p>

<h2>The real question: which pain do you prefer?</h2>

<p>System 1 pain: lots of little losses and the temptation to “tweak” the rules. System 2 pain: long stretches of nothing and the temptation to invent trades because you’re bored.</p>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Honest moment</div>

<p>Most people don’t quit because the system “failed.” They quit because the system did what it always does: it looked dumb for a while before it looked smart. Your job is to pick the kind of dumb you can tolerate.</p>
</div>

<h2>A simple way to choose (no personality quiz needed)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you hate missing moves and you’re okay with more trades → start with System 1.</li>

  <li>If you hate noise and prefer fewer decisions → start with System 2.</li>

  <li>If you’re unsure → run System 2 for 8 weeks on paper. If boredom kills it, you learned something valuable.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Drawdowns: what “normal” looks like</h2>

<p>Trend following drawdowns aren’t a bug. They’re the admission price. System 1 can look like a string of papercuts. System 2 can look like your strategy forgot your name. In both cases, position sizing is what keeps those phases survivable.</p>

<h2>How to stick with your choice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Write your rules down in one page. If it needs 12 pages, you built a bureaucracy, not a system.</li>

  <li>Pick a review schedule (weekly). Not “whenever you’re stressed.”</li>

  <li>Track rule-breaking. Rule-breaking is the real performance killer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple position sizing example (numbers make this click)</h2>

<p>Say your account is $10,000 and you decide to risk 1% per trade. That’s $100. You measure ATR, set a stop distance (often around 2×ATR), and then you size the position so a stop-out loses about $100. That’s how you make each trade equally survivable, even when markets have different volatility.</p>

<p>Example: if your stop distance is $4, you can take roughly 25 shares ($100 / $4). If the stop distance is $10, you take 10 shares. You didn’t “get scared.” The market just got wilder, so you got smaller. That’s the whole philosophy in one sentence.</p>

<h2>Media ideas (easy wins)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A 2–6 minute video: “Breakouts in one chart” + a quick tour of the <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.</li>

  <li>A simple infographic: the “Turtle loop” (Scan → Size → Enter → Stop → Exit → Repeat).</li>

  <li>A shareable checklist graphic (daily + weekly). People love screenshots more than they admit.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Builder note (optional)</div>

<p>Add a small “Share this” CTA after the first big section. People share when you saved them time or made them laugh — ideally both.</p>
</div>

<h2>A tiny story about sticking to rules (because this is where most people lose)</h2>

<p>Picture a normal losing streak: three trades in a row that stop out quickly. Nothing catastrophic, just annoying. Your brain starts negotiating: “Maybe the settings are wrong.” “Maybe I should wait for confirmation.” “Maybe I should just take smaller trades until it ‘feels’ better.”</p>

<p>That negotiation is the danger zone. Not because you’re dumb — because you’re human. Trend following looks worst right before it looks fine again, and the market has a talent for timing your doubts perfectly. The disciplined move is boring: keep the rules, keep the risk consistent, and review on your scheduled day.</p>

<p>If you want a practical way to lock this in, do two things: (1) write your rules in one page, and (2) track a “rule score” each week (0–100%). Improve the score before you change the strategy.</p>
