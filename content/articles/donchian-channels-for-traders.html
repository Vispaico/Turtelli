<p>Donchian channels are refreshingly boring. They don’t predict the future. They just tell you where price has been lately — the highest high and lowest low — and then they wait for price to do something new.</p>

<p>If Turtle Trading is the “rulebook,” Donchian channels are the ruler and the straight edge. This is the breakout tool behind <a href="/articles/turtle-trading-explained-beginner-guide">Turtle Trading Explained</a>.</p>

<div class="tldr-box">
  <div class="tldr-title">TL;DR</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Donchian channels mark the highest high and lowest low over a lookback; a break above/below signals a breakout/breakdown.</li>
    <li>Common Turtle settings: 20/10 for faster signals and whipsaws, 55/20 for slower, steadier trends.</li>
    <li>Execution and sizing matter more than the lines: decide stop-order vs. close-based entries, and use ATR sizing to keep losses small.</li>
    <li>The tool isn’t predictive—it’s a ruler; the edge comes from disciplined entries/exits and consistent risk.</li>

<h2>What a Donchian channel is</h2>

<p>A Donchian channel has an upper band (highest high over N periods) and a lower band (lowest low over N periods). When price breaks above the upper band, you have a breakout. When it breaks below the lower band, you have a breakdown.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>N</strong> controls how sensitive it is. Smaller N = more signals and more noise.</li>

  <li>High/low-based bands react to intraday extremes (useful for breakouts).</li>

  <li>You can use close-only variations, but that changes the system — be consistent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classic Turtle-style settings: 20/10 vs 55/20</h2>

<p>These are the two settings you see everywhere because they’re easy to understand and hard to “optimize” into nonsense.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>20/10:</strong> enter on 20-day breakout, exit on 10-day reversal. More trades. More little losses.</li>

  <li><strong>55/20:</strong> enter on 55-day breakout, exit on 20-day reversal. Fewer trades. More patience required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to trade the levels without getting chopped up</h2>

<p>Two things matter more than the indicator itself: (1) how you execute the breakout, and (2) how you size the trade. That’s where most “this doesn’t work” complaints are hiding.</p>

<h3>Execution: stop orders vs waiting for a close</h3>

<p>Stop orders get you in as soon as price breaks. That’s great when trends run. It’s also how you get filled on a fake-out. Waiting for a daily close can reduce noise, but you’ll miss some early moves. Pick one approach and test it — don’t mix them depending on how brave you feel that day.</p>

<h3>Sizing: the whipsaw antidote</h3>

<p>Whipsaws are normal. The point is to make them small. ATR-based sizing is the boring fix that actually helps. Read <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR for Turtle Trading</a>.</p>

<h2>A real-world example (fictional numbers, real behavior)</h2>

<p>Imagine a market has a 20-day high at 100. Price has tried to break 100 twice and failed. The third time, it finally trades to 101. That’s a breakout. Your job is not to “feel” if it’s real. Your job is to enter by rule, size by risk, and let the exit rule decide if you were right.</p>

<p>The market might run to 120 and you look like a genius. Or it might reverse to 95 and stop you out and you feel personally attacked. Both outcomes are part of the system. The edge is in the long series, not the one trade that ruined your lunch.</p>

<h2>Backtesting mistakes specific to Donchian channels</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lookahead bias:</strong> using today’s high/low inside the “past N days” window incorrectly.</li>

  <li><strong>Survivorship bias (stocks):</strong> only testing today’s winners.</li>

  <li><strong>Costs ignored:</strong> breakout fills are rarely “mid-price fantasy.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple position sizing example (numbers make this click)</h2>

<p>Say your account is $10,000 and you decide to risk 1% per trade. That’s $100. You measure ATR, set a stop distance (often around 2×ATR), and then you size the position so a stop-out loses about $100. That’s how you make each trade equally survivable, even when markets have different volatility.</p>

<p>Example: if your stop distance is $4, you can take roughly 25 shares ($100 / $4). If the stop distance is $10, you take 10 shares. You didn’t “get scared.” The market just got wilder, so you got smaller. That’s the whole philosophy in one sentence.</p>
