<p>Futures are the original Turtle playground: commodities, rates, currencies, indices — lots of markets, lots of diversification, and enough leverage to reward discipline (or punish optimism). This is where trend following gets its “multi-market” superpower.</p>

  <div class="tldr-title">TL;DR</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Futures fit Turtles well: many uncorrelated markets, easy shorts, and leverage that rewards discipline.</li>
    <li>Use Donchian breakouts for entries and ATR for sizing, but translate ATR into contract dollar risk (tick value, multiplier).</li>
    <li>Operational musts: know margin impacts, handle rolls consistently, and respect limit moves/slippage around breakouts.</li>
    <li>Diversify across sectors and keep a journal of roll decisions; size is the biggest survival lever.</li>

<h2>What makes futures special for trend following</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can trade many uncorrelated markets (energy, grains, rates, metals, equity index futures).</li>

  <li>Shorting is built-in; you’re not fighting stock borrow constraints.</li>

  <li>Macro trends can show up clearly across sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The futures reality check (so you don’t learn this from a margin call)</h2>

<p>The Turtle rules don’t care if you trade futures. Breakouts are breakouts. But every market has its own "gotcha" stack. In futures, the gotchas are usually boring operational stuff — the kind you skip, then pay for later. So here’s the boring stuff, served with fewer yawns.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract specs:</strong> tick value and contract size change your true risk.</li>

  <li><strong>Margin:</strong> it’s not “free money,” it’s a lever.</li>

  <li><strong>Rolls:</strong> contracts expire; your data and execution must match roll rules.</li>

  <li><strong>Limit moves:</strong> some markets can go limit and trap you temporarily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Costs and friction: the invisible tax</h2>

<p>If your backtest assumes perfect fills and zero costs, you didn’t build a strategy — you built fan fiction. futures has costs that show up at the worst possible time (usually right when price breaks out and everyone hits the same button).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commission:</strong> usually clear and predictable.</li>

  <li><strong>Slippage:</strong> can spike around breakouts and news.</li>

  <li><strong>Roll costs:</strong> rolling between contracts can affect P&L.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Quick tip</div>

<p>If you only fix one thing, fix sizing. The biggest performance difference between “survives for years” and “rage-quits in a week” is risk per trade. Read <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a> if you haven’t yet.</p>
</div>

<h2>Execution checklist (copy/paste this into your trading journal)</h2>

<p>This is the part where you turn “nice idea” into “actual process.” If you can’t do the steps below on a normal day when you’re tired, your system is too complicated.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Know contract specs (tick value, multiplier) before sizing.</li>

  <li>Use ATR sizing but convert it to dollar risk per contract.</li>

  <li>Have a roll plan and apply it consistently.</li>

  <li>Diversify across sectors instead of loading up on one theme.</li>

  <li>Journal trades and especially roll decisions.</li>

  <li>Weekly review: risk, correlation, and rule adherence.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data and backtesting sanity checks</h2>

<p>Backtests don’t lie on purpose. They lie because you accidentally asked the wrong question. Keep these checks simple and repeatable, and you’ll avoid the classic “why is live trading worse?” confusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backtest with data series that matches how you will roll live.</li>

  <li>Avoid confusing continuous charts with tradable prices.</li>

  <li>Stress test costs and slippage during volatile periods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple position sizing example (numbers make this click)</h2>

<p>Say your account is $10,000 and you decide to risk 1% per trade. That’s $100. You measure ATR, set a stop distance (often around 2×ATR), and then you size the position so a stop-out loses about $100. That’s how you make each trade equally survivable, even when markets have different volatility.</p>

<p>Example: if your stop distance is $4, you can take roughly 25 shares ($100 / $4). If the stop distance is $10, you take 10 shares. You didn’t “get scared.” The market just got wilder, so you got smaller. That’s the whole philosophy in one sentence.</p>
