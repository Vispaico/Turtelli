<p>If System 1 (20-day breakout) is a caffeinated day trader, <strong>System 2 (55-day breakout)</strong> is a wise old owl. It trades less often. It filters out the noise. It is designed for people who have jobs, families, or simply hate getting whipsawed.</p>

<p>The philosophy of System 2 is: "I am willing to be late to the party, as long as I can be sure it's a <em>real</em> party." You give up the first chunk of the trend (the entry is later) to avoid the false starts that kill System 1 traders.</p>

<h2>The Core Rules (System 2)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entry Rule:</strong> Buy when price exceeds the High of the preceding 55 days. Sell Short when price drops below the Low of the preceding 55 days.</li>

  <li><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> 2 × ATR (N) from the entry price. (Standard Turtle risk).</li>

  <li><strong>Exit Rule:</strong> Exit Long when price touches the 20-day Low. Exit Short when price touches the 20-day High.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Trade-off: Late Entry, Wide Exit</h2>

<p>Let's be honest about the pain points of System 2.</p>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Pain Point 1: Being Late</div>

<p>By the time price breaks a 55-day high, the trend might already be up 15% or 20% from the bottom. Your brain will scream: "I missed it! It's too expensive!" <strong>Reframe:</strong> You didn't miss it. You let the System 1 traders take the risk of the early reversal. You are paying a premium for a higher probability trend.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Pain Point 2: Giving Back Profits</div>

<p>The exit is the 20-day low. In a strong trend, the 20-day low might be far below the current price. You might ride a stock from $100 to $200, then watch it fall to $170 before the 20-day exit triggers. Giving back $30 of profit feels terrible. But it is necessary to stay in the trend for the move to $300 or $400.</p>
</div>

<h2>What Markets Fit System 2?</h2>

<p>System 2 relies on "fat tails"—trends that go on for months or years. It does not work well in mean-reverting chop.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commodities:</strong> <a href="/articles/turtle-trading-in-futures">Futures</a> like Oil, Copper, or Wheat. Supply shocks take a long time to resolve. System 2 eats these up.</li>

  <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> <a href="/articles/turtle-trading-in-crypto">Bitcoin</a> bull runs are historic. System 2 keeps you in through the 30% corrections that shake out weaker hands.</li>

  <li><strong>Currencies:</strong> Interest rate divergence trends (e.g., USD/JPY) can last for years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System 2 vs. The "Filter Rule"</h2>

<p>Unlike System 1, <strong>System 2 has no filter.</strong> You take every single 55-day breakout. Why? Because 55-day breakouts are rare. If a market hits a 55-day high, something significant has changed. If you skip one, you are almost guaranteed to miss the year's best trade.</p>

<h2>Expectations: The Boredom is Real</h2>

<p>You might go 3 months without a trade. You might check the dashboard every day for 12 weeks and see nothing but "Hold" or "Flat." (See <a href="/articles/trading-signals-hold-meaning">Article 013</a>).</p>

<p>This is why System 2 is perfect for part-time traders.</p>
<ul>
  <li>- <strong>System 1</strong> requires checking the market daily, urgently.</li>

  <li>- <strong>System 2</strong> allows you to check the market daily, calmly.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you miss a System 2 entry by 4 hours, it rarely matters. If you miss a System 1 entry by 4 hours, you might miss the move.</p>

<h2>Pyramiding in System 2</h2>

<p>Because System 2 entries are safer (higher win rate), Aggressive Turtles often pyramid more heavily here. <strong>Standard Pyramid Rule:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>- Enter 1 Unit at Breakout.</li>

  <li>- Enter 1 Unit at Breakout + 0.5N.</li>

  <li>- Enter 1 Unit at Breakout + 1.0N.</li>

  <li>- Move stops up aggressively.</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows you to build a massive position in a safe trend, while keeping your initial risk small.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong><br>If you want excitement, trade System 1.<br>If you want wealth and a lower ulcer rate, trade System 2.</p>

<h2>A quick, realistic walkthrough (the kind your brain actually needs)</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple play-by-play, because most “strategy explanations” are missing the only part that matters: what you do on a normal Tuesday. Picture this: you scan your list once a day. One market is breaking above its recent highs. Your job is not to guess the top or get poetic. Your job is to follow the steps you already decided on a calm day. If you want the full “start here” path, the hub is <a href="/articles">Articles</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the level (the breakout point) and confirm it’s a real “new high” for your chosen window.</li>

  <li>Calculate your risk using ATR. If volatility is huge, your position will be smaller. That’s not a bug.</li>

  <li>Place the entry and the stop. Put the stop in the system, not in your imagination.</li>

  <li>After entry, stop watching every tick. If you must stare at something, stare at your rules.</li>

  <li>Exit by rule: either a reversal level hits, or your stop hits. Your mood is not on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get stopped out quickly. That’s normal. The system is built around the idea that a few big trends pay for a bunch of small “nope” trades.</p>

<h2>Risk rules that keep you in the game</h2>

<p>Here’s the unglamorous truth: most people don’t “lose to the market.” They lose to their own sizing. They take a normal strategy and turn it into a stress test by risking too much when they feel confident and too little when they feel scared. Turtle-style risk rules try to remove that swingy behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a fixed risk per trade</strong> (a small percent of your account). Write it down.</li>

  <li><strong>Use ATR for stop distance</strong> so you’re not placing stops inside normal noise.</li>

  <li><strong>Size from risk</strong>: wider stop → smaller position; tighter stop → larger position.</li>

  <li><strong>Cap your total exposure</strong> so one theme (or one sector) can’t dominate your portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this feels like “too much math,” good news: it’s simple math. And it’s worth it. Start with <a href="/articles/atr-for-turtle-trading-stops-position-sizing">ATR sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>The boredom problem (and how to stop sabotaging yourself)</h2>

<p>A lot of traders don’t have a strategy problem — they have a boredom problem. Trend following is often quiet. That silence tricks you into “improving” the system with extra trades. That’s how people turn a good strategy into a messy hobby.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run scans on a schedule (daily or weekly). Outside that time, you’re done.</li>

  <li>Use alerts instead of constant chart-watching.</li>

  <li>Journal rule-breaking as a separate “expense.” It’s usually larger than commissions.</li>

  <li>If you need action, do something else: exercise, build tools, read. Not another trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple checklist you can follow without thinking</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Daily (or end-of-day) checklist</div>
<ol>
  <li>Scan your universe for breakouts (20D/55D levels).</li>

  <li>Confirm liquidity/cost constraints for the instrument you trade.</li>

  <li>Compute ATR and position size from your risk rule.</li>

  <li>Place entry + stop. If you can’t place a stop, you can’t place the trade.</li>

  <li>Log it. Future-you is your compliance officer.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Weekly checklist</div>
<ul>
  <li>Review every trade: did you follow rules, yes/no?</li>

  <li>Update the watchlist/universe only on the scheduled day.</li>

  <li>Check concentration: are you accidentally loaded up on one theme?</li>

  <li>Write one improvement for process (not “I wish price went up more”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Quick FAQ (because your brain will ask these anyway)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do I need a ton of indicators?</strong> Nope. Price levels + risk rules carry the system. Extra indicators mostly add extra ways to second-guess yourself.</li>

  <li><strong>Is a low win rate “bad”?</strong> Not for trend following. Many versions win less than half the time and still do fine because the winners can be much larger than the losers.</li>

  <li><strong>Do I need to watch charts all day?</strong> Not if you trade daily rules. You can run a boring schedule and let the rules do the heavy lifting. The <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> is literally built for quick scanning.</li>

<h2>Share-friendly summary (steal this for socials)</h2>

<div class="callout">  <div class="callout-title">Copy/paste</div>

<p>Turtle Trading is rules-based trend following: buy breakouts, size by volatility (ATR), and exit by rules. It’s boring on purpose — and that’s the point. If you want the clean entry/exit levels, read <a href="/articles/donchian-channels-for-traders">Donchian channels</a>.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes (and the exact fix for each)</h2>

<p>Most “strategy failures” are just process failures in a trench coat. Here are the usual suspects, plus what to do instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Moving stops because you “feel” it’s about to bounce. <strong>Fix:</strong> Decide stops before entry and treat them like a contract you signed with your calmer self.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Taking every signal in the same sector/theme. <strong>Fix:</strong> cap exposure and diversify; correlation loves to ambush people.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Changing parameters after a losing streak. <strong>Fix:</strong> lock rules for a fixed evaluation window (e.g. 8–12 weeks).</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring costs. <strong>Fix:</strong> assume worse fills on breakouts and test with conservative assumptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Overtrading because you’re bored. <strong>Fix:</strong> schedule scans; outside scan time, do literally anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A simple position sizing example (numbers make this click)</h2>

<p>Say your account is $10,000 and you decide to risk 1% per trade. That’s $100. You measure ATR, set a stop distance (often around 2×ATR), and then you size the position so a stop-out loses about $100. That’s how you make each trade equally survivable, even when markets have different volatility.</p>

<p>Example: if your stop distance is $4, you can take roughly 25 shares ($100 / $4). If the stop distance is $10, you take 10 shares. You didn’t “get scared.” The market just got wilder, so you got smaller. That’s the whole philosophy in one sentence.</p>
